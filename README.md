# CMPSC 100-03: Optional Final Project

* Assigned: 18 October 2019
* Due: 15 December 2019, by 11:00 AM
* Point value: 100 pts

## Project description

Throughout the semester, we've checked in on our friend, the Gator Wizard, who has asked us to help with various computational tasks. Largely, we accomplish this via a narrative which communicates key details of a given scenario which factor into the computational solutions requested by the "problem." For the final, optional, course project, your task is to write a lab-level "G. Wiz" problem which teaches a topic we've discussed during the semester. This can be from as early as `Week 0` or as current as a topic as current as one from `Week 12+`.

While the overall topic is up to you, a full realized project should contain:

### `README.md`
- [ ] A `README` document (replacing this one) which uses the `template.md` (located in `project`) for its structure and:
    * Contains no `TODO` markers
    * Contains no instances of {Your Name Here}
    * Contains a story problem with an original title
    * Contains complete itemized lists of grading criteria for each file required by the exercise
    * Retains all "boilerplate" language typical of a lab assignment for the course (this will be included in `template.md`)
    
### Code
- [ ] Working solution in code located in the `src/main/java` directory in a subdirectory named according to your topic which:
    * Contains complete `Javadoc` comments for all `classes` and `methods` (see `Appendix J` in _JSS_)
    * Passes `gradle build`
    * Passes `gradle run`
- [ ] "Broken," "starter" code located in the `src/test/java/` directory in a subdirectory named according to your topic which:
    * Contains complete `Javadoc` comments for all `classes` and `methods` (see `Appendix J` in _JSS_)
    * Uses `TODO` markers to direct students to areas requiring completion

### Reflections
- [ ] A "starter" `reflection.md` file located in the `writing` directory using correct markdown which:
    * Contains at least 5 questions posed heading tags
    * Uses "how," "why," or other questions prompting students to write extended answers
    * Uses at least 1 blank code block
- [ ] A reflection on your process creating this exercise which responds to questions located in `project-reflection.md` file in the `project` directory which:
    * Contains no `TODO` markers
